    </center>
    <p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    <b>This service is 99% distributed.</b> This means you should start seeding before you start reading and accessing the content. Install an ipfs client and connect through the http gateway it provides for you. This website is just a list of files hosted on a distributed network, a tracker, if you will. For the best possible experience we also recommend that you install the ipfs-companion browser plugin. This does not mean you should rely on the public gateway, because this site would not be able to stay up. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    You have the option of either a <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop">GUI client</a> or an assortment of other <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/dist.ipfs.io/">CLI-based tools</a>. Once you have the service running in the background it will translate the content and allow you to view it in your browser. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    Make sure to pin your favorite manga to make sure that it sticks around. This tells ipfs to always keep a local copy and help out with content distribution. <br>
